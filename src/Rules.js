                <h1>SUNDAY SCHOOL: RANK AND FILE</h1>
                <h3>2024–25 Season Rules</h3>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                Hello and welcome (or welcome back) to year three of the <span class="italic-text">Sunday School: Rank and File</span> NFL pool! Last year, we enjoyed an excellent year with the introduction of our  proprietary picks-submission website, and we hope to build on that success this year. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                A few important points for new members:
                <br></br>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  This pool is primarily for fun, and the wagers exist to compliment that fun, not  detract from it. Participants should share that spirit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Although certain winnings are calculated on a weekly basis, this pool is meant to  be a season-long activity. Winnings are not paid until the end of the season, and  participants are expected to participate every week (that said, late adds will be  permitted, and participants are not formally forbidden from dropping out). 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Our pool basically operates as a straight-up confidence pool with some added  bonuses. Unlike other pools, participants will not rank each and every game.  Instead, the pool will be divided into a “Rank” portion and a “File” portion.  Players will rank only Sunday games—the “Rank.” Participants will also predict  the winner of the Monday Night Football (“MNF”) games—the “File.”  Thanksgiving and Christmas will feature special components, and all players will  participate in a separate playoff round. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br></br><br></br>
                </p>
                <h2>The Rank</h2>
                <p>
                Each week, you will pick the straight-up winner of every Sunday NFL game (excluding
                international games or game kicking off before 1:00 p.m. ET) and set a “rank” for each
                game. This functions more or less as a confidence pool: if the team you picked wins the
                game, you will be awarded the number of points corresponding to the rank that you
                assigned to that game. For example, if you picked the Green Bay Packers to beat the
                Chicago Bears, and you ranked that game at #11 for the week, you would be awarded 11
                points if Green Bay wins. You will always rank each game from 1 to the total number of
                games there are that particular Sunday. So, if there are 14 games on a given Sunday, you
                will rank each game from 1 to 14, with #14 presumably being the team that you are most
                confident will win their game that week. If a game ties, players will be awarded their full
                points for that game.<br></br><br></br>
                There will a 20-point bonus awarded for getting your #1–#5 ranked games correct in a
                given week. There will also be a 40-point bonus for achieving a perfect Sunday in a given
                week. Tied games do not count as wins for the #1–5 bonus or the perfect week bonus.
                You do not have to get your “File” game (see below) correct to get a perfect week.<br></br><br></br>
                As discussed below, there will be both weekly and season winners. Each week, your
                points totals reset for purposes of determining the weekly winners, but your points
                totals will accrue from week to week for purposes of calculating the season winners.
                </p>
                <h2>The File</h2>
                <p>
                In addition to picking Sunday games each week, we will also pick the winner of MNF
games. Each MNF game that you pick correctly will go to your “File.” Tie games will also
count as File wins. <span class="bold-text">The File will not count towards your weekly or season point
totals, and it will not directly pay out any money. </span> However, the season winner of
the File will have their total Playoffs Bucks tripled (see more on Playoffs below), and the
second-place File finisher will have their Playoffs Bucks doubled. If two or more players
tie for first or second place in the season-long File standings, all players tied for first or
second will receive the respective Playoffs bonus.<br></br><br></br>
During Week 13, the 3 games played on Thursday, November 28 (Thanksgiving Day)
will be part of the File (in addition to the regular MNF game played on December 2).
Hitting all three Thanksgiving games is a <span class="bold-text">Turkey Trifecta</span>, and it adds 3 bonus wins <span class="bold-text">to your
                File</span> (in addition to the three total File wins necessarily awarded for winning each
                game).<br></br><br></br>
                During Week 17, the 3 games played on Monday, December 25 (Christmas Day) and
Thursday, December 26 will be part of the File (in addition to the regular MNF game(s)
played on December 30). Hitting all three Christmas games is a <span class="bold-text">Santa Hat Trick</span>, and it awards
                3 bonus wins <span class="bold-text">to your File</span> (in addition to the three total File wins necessarily awarded
                for winning each game).<br></br><br></br>
                Hitting <span class="italic-text">both</span> the Turkey Trifecta <span class="italic-text">and</span> Santa Hat Trick awards an additional three bonus
                wins <span class="bold-text">to your File</span>.
                </p>
                <h2>Playoffs</h2>
                <p>
                All players will participate in the Playoffs. Players earn 100 Playoff Bucks for each
straight-up Rank win or tie, regardless of how the player ranked each game. Then, as
discussed above, the season-long winner(s) and runner(s)-up of the File will have their
Playoffs Bucks tripled or doubled respectively prior to the start of the Playoffs.<br></br><br></br>
During the Playoffs, players may wager some, all, or none of their Playoffs Bucks on
games during every round, up to and including the Super Bowl. These wagers will be 1:1
bets made against a points spread, which will be pulled from a national sportsbook and
circulated (and thereafter locked into place) at some time prior to each game. If any of
these single-game spread bets push, the wagered Playoff Bets will be returned. For the
first two rounds of the Playoffs, players may also make one parlay bet for 4 games in round. In the wildcard round, the player would select 4 of the 6 games to include in the
parlay. In the divisional round, the player would pick all 4 games in the parlay. The
parlay bet pays 11:1. If any leg of your parlay results in a push, the parlay will lose.<br></br><br></br>
No Playoffs Bucks will roll over from season to season. The Playoffs pot will be awarded
to the player with the most Playoffs Bucks after the Super Bowl, with players tied for
first splitting the pot (even if every player ends the Super Bowl with 0 Playoffs Bucks).
                </p>
                <h2>Dues and Payouts</h2>
                <p>
                Each player will pay <span class="bold-text">$10/week</span> to participate, including the Commissioner. Total dues
                for the season are thus $180. As outlined previously, the pool is <span class="bold-text">expected to be a
                season-long activity,</span>though players may join late and are not formally prohibited
from dropping out. Any player who drops out is not eligible for the season or playoffs
pot. For simplicity’s sake,<span class="bold-text">it is preferable that each player pay in advance for the
season</span>(or at least $90, representing half of the season), but accommodations can be
made if necessary.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The pool will go forward no matter how many or how few players enter. The money
                collected each week will be divided in this fashion:
                <br></br><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">1) 65% to the weekly pot</span><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">2) 20% to the season pot</span><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">3) 15% to the playoffs pot</span><br></br><br></br>
                Each week, the weekly pot will be divided in this fashion:<br></br><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">1) 65% to the 1st place player</span><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">2) 25% to the 2nd place player</span><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">3) 10% to the 3rd place player</span><br></br><br></br>
                A tie at any level of the weekly pot will cause the winnings of the next-lowest tier to be
                “pulled up” to and shared among the tier containing the tie (and this process will be
                repeated if there are multiple ties). For example, if two players tie for first in a given
                week, those two players will equally share 90% of the weekly pot (the first-place amount
                of 65% and the “pulled up” second-place amount of 25%). The second-place player will
                then earn 10% (the third-place winnings), and the third-place player will earn nothing.
                If three or more players tie for first, the entire weekly pot will be split among only those
                tied for first. This ensures that the second- or third-place finishers cannot earn more
                than tying first-place finishers, which happened on several occasions last year.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The season pot will be divided in this fashion:<br></br><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">1) $180 to the 2nd place player (awarded only if at least 10 players participate all
                  year)</span><br></br>
                <span class="indented-text">2) the rest to the 1st place player.</span><br></br><br></br>
                The commissioner will personally guarantee all payouts.
                </p>
                <h2>Submitting Picks</h2>
                <p>
                Players will submit picks through our proprietary picks-submission website: 
                <span class="italic-text"> sundayschoolrankpool.com</span> (<span className='bold-text'>note that this website differs from last year</span>). When players join the pool, they will create an account and login to submit picks.<br></br><br></br>
                <span class="bold-text">All players must submit picks through the picks-submission link by kickoff
                of the first wagered game of the week</span> (because international games are excluded, this means
                the deadline is 1:00PM ET on Sunday in every week except Week 13, which will be
                12:30PM ET on Thursday, November 28, and in Week 17, which will be 1:00
                p.m. ET on Wednesday, December 25). Games prior to our first
                played game (<span class="italic-text">i.e.</span> Thursday Night Football games, Friday games, Saturday games, and
                international games) will not appear on the weekly picks survey.<br></br><br></br>
                
                If a player fails to submit picks on time, they will not be eligible to participate in the
                Rank that week (dues are still assessed), but they may still make a File selection prior to
                the File game kickoff by emailing the Commissioner. If a player fails to submit picks on
                time in a holiday week, they may submit picks directly to the commissioner for any
                games that have not been played, except that if <span class="italic-text">any</span> Rank game has started, <span class="italic-text">no</span> Rank
                picks may be made.<br></br><br></br>
                If any player fails to submit Rank picks on time, they will be assessed the lowest number
                of Rank points earned by any player that week. This helps ensure that missing a week
                does not take a player out of contention for the season pot.<br></br><br></br>
                Players are encouraged to submit picks early to avoid any technical issues, particularly
                in the early weeks of the pool. If any player needs assistance with submitting picks, they
                are encouraged to contact the commissioner.<br></br><br></br>
                The pick-submission website will be administered by the Commissioner and a non-player, Charlie Thompson. Only the Commissioner and Charlie will have access to
                players’ picks, and they will not disseminate players’ picks prior to kickoff. To ensure
                fairness, the Commissioner will email his own picks at least 24 hours prior to kickoff to
                a different member of the pool (not a member of his own family) each week. The
                Commissioner will email his Playoffs wagers to the entire pool simultaneously to
                announcing the spread lines.
                </p>
                <h2>Viewing Picks and Results</h2>
                <p>
                Players will be able to see picks and results after each game via a Google Sheet. This
                Google Sheet will be shared with players via email and will be updated with all players’
                picks shortly after kickoff. The Sheet will be updated with results throughout game days.
                Additionally, players may make their own local copy of the Sheet and use the game interface to test how different game outcomes might influence the results. If any player
                has questions about the Sheet, they are encouraged to contact the Commissioner.
                </p>
                <h2>Parting Thoughts and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>
                The goal is that we all have a very fun and entertaining season as we have in years past.
                Although the pool is now in its third year, there nonetheless may be considerations that
                I have overlooked or forgotten to mention. All unforeseen scenarios will be judged in
                the Commissioner’s sole discretion with an eye towards fairness and after opportunity
                for notice and comment from the players. If you have any questions or suggestions,
                please let me know. With luck, we will expand and grow in future years. Good luck to all!
